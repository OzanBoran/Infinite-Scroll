# Infinite Scroll

This project implements an infinite scrolling feature to visualize a virtually endless amount of photos from Unsplash using their API. The application utilizes JavaScript and DOM manipulation to achieve a seamless social media-like infinite scroll method, allowing users to browse through a vast collection of images without the need for traditional pagination.

## Technologies Used

- **Unsplash API**: The project leverages the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images. Unsplash provides a vast collection of freely-usable images, making it an excellent resource for developers and designers.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for implementing the infinite scrolling functionality. It dynamically loads new images as the user scrolls down the page.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated using JavaScript to insert new image elements into the HTML document, creating a smooth and continuous scrolling experience.
